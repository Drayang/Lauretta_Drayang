## Using TorchReid and Yolo model for real time person reidentification

I implemented “TorchReid”, which is a deep learning person re-identification approach in PyTorch developed by Zhou Kai Yang and his team for ICCV’19, [Omni-Scale Feature Learning for Person Re-Identification ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00953). Torchreid is a library for deep-learning person re-identification, written in [PyTorch ](https://pytorch.org/).
